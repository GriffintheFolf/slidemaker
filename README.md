# slidemaker

slidemaker is a small HTML webpage set to generate video from text slides.
It is useful when a message needs to be quickly conveyed without having to open
video editing or other software.

## browser requirements

Any semi-modern browser should work just fine. More specifically, it needs to
support canvases and the `<input type="color">` tag, which has been supported
since Chrome 20, Firefox 29, and Safari 10.1.

## licence

slidemaker is licenced under the MIT Licence.

It uses the [whammy](https://github.com/antimatter15/whammy) library, also
under the MIT Licence.
